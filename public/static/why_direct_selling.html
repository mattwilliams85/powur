            <h1>Why Direct Selling?</h1>
            <div class="container align-left">
                <p>
Solar is finally ready for direct selling.  
                </p>
                <p>
The direct sales industry generates over $160 billion dollars per year in revenue, with over 90,000,000 active distributors.  That is a HUGE industry.  In America alone, it’s over $30 billion a year, with 16.8 million active direct sellers.
                </p>
                
                <div class="image-holder"></div>
                
                <p>
Think of how many millions of americans earn their livelihood through direct selling.  We all know someone in direct sales, have bought something, or have been part of a company ourselves.  The industry is so big in fact, it just wasn’t possible for solar to keep up with the pace direct sales could grow… until now.
                </p>
                <p>
Billions of dollars and millions of man hours have gone into manufacturing, finance, and installation systems that now have solar ready to scale across the country.  What’s missing are passionate, enthusiastic, financially motivated people who want to build a business championing the cause.

            <div class="container align-left">
                <p>
There is no industry as good at spreading products via word of mouth as ours.  Despite the often misunderstood nature of direct sales, the numbers don’t lie.  Direct sales has the potential to create millions of solar customers over the next decade… and generate BILLIONS in wealth for those who do.
                </p>
                <p>
We believe sunstand could be the start of a MEGA trend.  A tipping point that sends solar on the "influxion” point everyone has theorized for years.  With the cost of traditional electricity constantly increasing, and the cost of solar REDUCING every year... it's just a matter of time before qualified homeowners make the switch to the cheaper, cleaner energy source.  They call it “grid parity”... and it’s happening now.                </p>
                <p>
Referral marketing is the #1 source of new solar customers, and with Sunstand, we take the power of referral marketing to new heights.  If you’ve ever wanted to own your own business, have an unlimited income potential, and do something that leaves a lasting impact on our world for Centuries to come… you could not be in a better place at a better time.                  
                </p>
                <p>
Oh, and one more thing.
