                    What's astounding, is that this is just the beginning.  Every year, the cost of solar gets lower and the cost of traditional electricity goes up.  Yet the vast majority of Americans are currently unaware that they can power their lives with clean, renewable solar energy more cost effectively than traditional utilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
    Currently, less than 1% of of U.S. homes have solar installed.  That's an opportunity estimated to be as large as 48 million homes, and north of $100,000,000,000+ annually.

    There's no doubt that we are at the beginning of the shift from dirty to clean energy... and likely one of the most meaningful wealth transfers in history.  Many billions of dollars will change hands as the "power" shifts from fossil fuels to clean, renewable technology.  These are exciting times.
