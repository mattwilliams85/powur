          <p>The solar industry has gone through massive change in the last decade as companies have innovated the financial models, the manufacturing, the design systems, the ease of permitting, the installer networks, and the list goes on.</p>
          <p>Solar is now in a position where after 40 years of innovation, it is finally ready to scale across the country.  What the industry needs now… is distribution.  That’s where you, and direct selling, enters the picture.  The greatest opportunity existing in solar is to acquire new customers, and put more panels on more rooftops.</p>
