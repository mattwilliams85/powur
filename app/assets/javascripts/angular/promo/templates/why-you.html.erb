          <p>We believe solar is not only one of the greatest financial opportunities you might see in a lifetime, but also an incredible opportunity to shift the scales of power on planet earth for the betterment of us all.  For the last 150 years, a very small group of companies has controlled the “power”, meaning the energy markets, almost exclusively.</p>

          <p>Instead of the wealth of energy only flowing to oil or coal companies… the wealth from the energy industry can now flow through the hands of people just like you.  By sharing solar person to person, we return power back to the people both financially (by getting paid), and literally, by powering our homes from our own rooftops.  This is “power to the people” in its truest sense.</p>
          <p>The time has never been better to join the cause, and live a meaningful, rewarding life… while building a high income business making a difference.  Your great grand-children will thank you one day for taking your stand, and the wealth they may inherit!</p>
