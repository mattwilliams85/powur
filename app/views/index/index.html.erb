		<p>At the moment, solar represents only a tiny fraction of the $150 billion residential energy market in the United States. However, between rapidly falling costs, aggressive rebate and financing programs, and increasing concerns over disasters caused by coal and other "dirty" energy companies, solar power in America is set to explode. Sunstand is the first direct sales platform that is 100% focused on this coming solar revolution. <p>

	<h2>There's never been a easier time to sell solar panels.</h2>

	<p>Sunstand has partnered with Sunrun to offer customers a no-brainer deal to get started with solar. $0 down financing, $0 installation fees, and instead of paying the electric company every month, customers just make a guaranteed low monthly payment on the panels themselves.</p>

	<span class="deal_points"><i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>0<br/>Down</span>
	<span class="deal_points"><i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>0<br/>Installation</span>
	<span class="deal_points">10-30%<br/>Off monthly</span>

	<p>As a Sunstand Advocate, you'll find customers, do a quick screen to make sure they could benefit from solar, and collect some information from their electric bill so Sunrun can get them a quote. When those quotes go to installation, you get a commission. It's an easy job, but one that's hard for a national company like Sunrun to scale - which makes it perfect for direct sale Advocates like you.</p>
