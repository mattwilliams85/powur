	<h2>The solar revolution is coming, and it will be disruptive.</h2>
	
	<p>Right now, solar represents only a tiny fraction of the $150 billion residential energy market in the United States. However, between rapidly falling production costs, aggressive rebate and financing programs, and increasing concerns over disasters caused by coal and other "dirty" energy companies, solar power in America is set to explode. Sunstand is the first direct sales platform that is 100% focused on this coming solar revolution.

	<h2>There's never been a easier time to sell solar.</h2>

	<p>Sunstand has partnered with Sunrun to offer customers a no-brainer deal to get started with solar. $0 down financing, no installation or maintenance fees, and instead of paying the electric company, customers just make the same low payment every month on the panels themselves.</p>

	<span class="deal_points">$0<br/>Down</span>
	<span class="deal_points">$0<br/>Install</span>
	<span class="deal_points">10-30%<br/>Monthly</span>

	<p>As a Sunstand Advocate, you'll 1) connect with homeowners, 2) do a quick screen to make sure they could benefit from solar, and 3) collect some information from their electric bill so Sunrun can get them a quote. When those quotes go to installation, you get a commission. It's an easy task, but one that's hard for a national company like Sunrun to scale using full-time employees. Couple this with the coming solar boom, and you've got an incredible opportunity for direct sales.</p>

	<h2>You're growing a business, so don't go it alone.</h2>
	
	<p>The real power of direct selling lies in the ability for advocates to recruit other advocates. The more people you recruit, the bigger your team and the greater your impact on our environment. And of course, as your team members, when they sell, you earn.</p>

	<p>Because we're passionate about changing the world, it will always be free to become a Sunstand Advocate. The more you grow your business, the more rewards and perks you'll see. When the time comes, upgrading to a Pro account gets you access to advanced tools, training and reporting so you can make an even bigger impact.</p>

	<h2>It's not just about selling. It's about doing good.</h2>

	<p>While we know that the solar industry is going to provide an incredible opportunity to shift wealth, create jobs, build new companies and invigorate our economy, we understand that it's more than just a booming market.</p>

	<p>The real opportunity here is in chaning the course of human history.</p>

	<p>Now, that may sound a little grand, but the truth is that our environment needs that change to happen, and it's not going to come from the top - it's going to come from people like you. By decentralizing energy production and shifting the wealth away from oil and coal companies, we're disrupting their ability to influence policy-makers and pollute our environment. This is how we make a difference. This is what it's all about.</p>

	<p>This is giving power back to the people.</p>
