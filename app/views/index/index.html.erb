	<h2>The solar revolution is here, and it will be disruptive.</h2>
	
	<p>Right now, solar represents only a tiny fraction of the $120 billion residential energy market in the United States. However, between rapidly falling production costs, aggressive rebate and financing programs, and increasing concerns over disasters caused by coal and other "dirty" energy companies, solar power in America is exploding. Sunstand is the first direct sales platform 100% focused on this coming solar revolution.</p>

	<h2>U.S. Solar Growth vs. Price per Watt</h2>

	<div id="solar_growth"></div>

	<h2>There's never been a easier time to sell solar.</h2>

	<p>Sunstand has partnered with Sunrun to offer customers a no-brainer deal to get started with solar. $0 down financing, no installation or maintenance fees, and instead of paying the electric company, customers just make the same low payment every month on the panels themselves.</p>

	<div id="deal_points">
		<span class="deal_point">
			<span>$0<br/>Down</span>
		</span>
		<span class="deal_point">
			<span>$0<br/>Install</span>
		</span>
		<span class="deal_point">
			<span>Save<br/>10-30%<br/>Monthly</span>
		</span>
	</div>

	<p>As a Sunstand Advocate, you'll 1) connect with homeowners, 2) do a quick screen to make sure they could benefit from solar, and 3) collect some information from their electric bill so Sunrun can get them a quote. When those quotes go to installation, you get a commission. It's an easy task, but one that's hard for a national company like Sunrun to scale using full-time employees. Couple this with the coming solar boom, and you've got an incredible opportunity to participate in the $120 billion dollar annual residential solar market.</p>

	<h2>It's not just about solar. It's about doing good.</h2>

	<p>While we know that the solar industry is going to provide an incredible opportunity to shift wealth, create jobs, build new companies, and invigorate our economy, we understand that it's more than just a booming market.</p>

	<p>The real opportunity here is in changing the course of human history.</p>

	<p>Now, that may sound a little grand, but the truth is that our environment needs that change to happen, and it's not going to come from the top - it's going to come from people like you. By decentralizing energy production with clean energy, and shifting the wealth away from oil and coal companies, we're disrupting their ability to influence policy-makers and pollute our environment. This is how we make a difference. This is what it's all about.</p>

	<h2>This is giving power back to the people, literally</strong></h2>
